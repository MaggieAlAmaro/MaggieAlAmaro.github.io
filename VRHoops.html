				<p style="display:inline">
					was a 2 people project for my course on virtual reality. This project was developed in <b>Unity</b>
					and made use of the <b>Unity XR Interaction Toolkit</b>.
					<br>
					The objective of the project was to be inspired by and improve upon
					an existing technology linked to VR.
					The theme assigned to us was a paper called
					<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7892280">Catching a Real Ball in Virtual Reality</a>,
					where a user
					is able to catch a real ball inside a VR environment.
					We improved upon this technology by adding motion sensory feedback throughout the ball's trajectory,
					and turned the calculation of the trajectory into a strategic element in a multiplayer basketball
					simulation game,
					where the players are placed in an obstacle course and must cooperate in order to reach the hoop and
					dunk the ball as fast as possible.
					<br>
					To incentivize cooperation the two players were restricted to different parts of the level, and were
					given some mechanics
					to facilitate communication like pin-pointing locations with the controller pointer, see-through
					walls, and a
					top-down map of the level.
					We also ended up adding some other features such as resizing the ball, rotating the hoop and
					customizing the appearance of
					the ball and the player's hands.
					<br>

					class="button style1">Video Demonstration</a>

				<p>
					I wish I had had more time to refine this product but my access to the HDMs was limited to the
					duration of the course. It was a great experience
					and I hope to develop more games in VR in the future.
					<br>
					The features I worked on include:
				</p>


				<h2 style="padding-top: 2rem;">Multiplayer</h2>
				<p>
					The multiplayer functionality was implemented using <b>Photon</b> and the Unity <b>Photon Pun 2</b>
					package. Photon allows for the creation
					of a server to host the game and the corresponding Unity package contains functions for controlling
					the multiplayer objects and
					environment. Using this package I first coded the connection of the players into the server, then
					made sure every relevant object
					had a <i>photonView</i> component to identify it across the network. With this component I was able
					to spawn the players on the server.
					After making sure each player was controlling separate characters, I worked on having objects'
					properties (i.e. the player's position)
					sync over the network, using the <i>PhotonTransformView</i> component.
					Finally, <i>Pun</i> Remote procedure calls (PunRPC) were used for some functionality like setting
					the haptic feedback intensity of
					the other player's controller based on his distance to the ball.
				</p>

				<h2 style="padding-top: 2rem;">Ball Trajectory Prediction</h2>
				<p>
					I was in charge of creating a way for the players to visualize the predicted trajectory of the ball
					when they performed a "throw simulation".
					The simulated throw followed the same pattern as a normal throw (where a player holds down the grip
					button, performs a throwing motion and releases the grip button) but
					in the simulated throw the player had to hold down the <u>grip</u> button during the entire motion
					and use the <u>trigger</u> button in the
					same hold, perform motion and release pattern as in a normal throw. This action then triggered the
					Trajectory Prediction mechanic which consisted of
					using the position and velocity vector values recorded by the controller to solve for the time of
					flight of a projectile (using
					Kinematic Equations).
					The time of flight then allowed for the placement of several points along the trajectory path, which
					were also calculated with
					kinematic equations, and finally a line renderer was used to draw a line between those points.
				</p>
				<h2 style="padding-top: 2rem;">Teleportation Movement</h2>
				<p>
					The teleportation locomotion was implemented by me using the XR Toolkit teleportation components.
				</p>

				<h2 style="padding-top: 2rem;">Aesthetic elements</h2>
				<p>
					I also programmed some other aesthetic elements, like the pin signal and the ability to change
					the ball and the hand's material.

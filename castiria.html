				<p style="display:inline">

					was a 7 people project made in <b>Unity</b>. Out of the 7 people,
					4 came up with the game theme and were in charge of art assets. <br>
				</p>

				<p>
					I, along with 2 other developers, were
					in charge of programming and designing the game.

					<br>
					I loved working as part of a big team, I felt that through this experience I improved my
					organization and communication skills.
					Also, I'd never worked
					on a game with such an intricate and thoughtful story before and really enjoyed bringing this world
					to life.
					the final result isn't perfect, mostly due to time constraints, but I hope to revisit this project
					in the
					future and give it the love it deserves.

					<br>

					<br><br>
				<p>In this project, I worked on 3 main features:</p>

				</p>

				<h2 style="padding-top: 2rem;">Portals</h2>
				<p>
					The central puzzle mechanic was to be able to navigate and escape "the backrooms". This was done via
					"special doors", which can lead
					to a number of different rooms. A player can visualize what room a door currently leads and can
					iterate between the possible rooms.
					This was a particularly challenging task as it involved some complex camera and shader work. The
					solution was to disassemble the house
					structure into different 3D models, to be able to visualize different "house" configurations
					during runtime. Then the room that a door could lead to was rendered from the perspective of the
					player as if that room was actually through the door.

				</p>

				<h2 style="padding-top: 2rem;">Enemy AI</h2>
				<p>
					Since the AI was somewhat complex, this task was also worked on by the 2 other programmers. I worked
					on the AI for the "backrooms" level,
					where the enemy AI's main objective is to find the player, and must navigate the backrooms in order
					to do so.
					<br>
					The way the AI navigates the backrooms is probability-driven, meaning that the previously mentioned
					"special doors" that
					can lead to more than one room, will place the Enemy AI in one of those rooms according to some
					probability.
					The AI knows these probabilities and chooses which doors to go through by taking those values into
					account as well
					as the probability that a player is in a given room. To calculate these last values the AI keeps
					track of the rooms he has visited
					and gives better odds to those he hasn't been in recently.

				</p>
				<h2 style="padding-top: 2rem;">Level Design</h2>
				<p>
					I also worked in tandem with the 3D art team to coordinate the level design. Since the development
					cycle was quite small
					and we had different time constraints, the solution was to come up with concise game sequences that
					wouldn't be too
					demanding of the art team, so I ended up gathering some models online and reusing the ones provided
					by the art team in different levels.
					Since the reusability of assets fits with the theme, it doesn't disrupt the player's immersion or
					make the experience feel repetitive.

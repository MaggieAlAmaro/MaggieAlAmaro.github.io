				<p>
					The Game Of The Dizzy Goose is a different take on “The game of the
					goose”, sometimes also called “The royal game of the goose”.
					The original game is a dice-based game where the players race each other to see who can reach the
					end of the board first. Some dice combinations and spots on the board have special effects that
					affect the movement of the player or change the flow of the game.
					In my version, the players race eachother, not by playing dice but by playing cards that either move
					the player or affect the game in some way. </p>

				<p style="display:inline">
					This game was created for the GradsinGames 2024 Search for A Star challange.


					In this challenge, participants were given a base project in C++ and DirectX and had the liberty of
					adapt the existing code into a game of their choosing.
					The base project came with 3 rings and an arrow, and a user could select between the different rings
					and rotate them individually.
					Initially, I was taken aback by the fact that I had never programmed in C++ and had very little
					graphics programming knowledge, but I persevered through
					as it was a great opportunity to learn and improve in those in those areas. </p>

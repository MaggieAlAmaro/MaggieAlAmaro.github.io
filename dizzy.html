						The<h2 style="display:inline"> Game Of The Dizzy Goose</h2> is a different take on “The game of the goose”, sometimes also called “The royal game of the goose”.
								The original game is a dice-based game where the players race each other to see who can reach the end of the board 
								first. Some dice combinations and spots on the board have special effects that affect the movement of the player or
								 change the flow of the game.

							   In my version, the players race eachother, not by playing dice but by playing cards that either move the 
							   player or affect the game in some way.
							   </p>
							   <p style="display:inline"> 							
								This game was created for the GradsinGames 2024 Search for A Star challange. 
							

In this challenge, participants were given a base project in C++ and DirectX and had the liberty of adapt the existing code into a game of their choosing. 
The base project came with 3 rings and an arrow, and a user could select between the different rings and rotate them individually. 
 Initially, I was taken aback by the fact that I had never programmed in C++ and had very little graphics programming knowledge, but I perservered through 
 as it was a great opportunity to learn and improve in those in those areas. </p>
